# BOMG

I helped a local business redesign and modernize their website. The original design was outdated, not user friendly, and lacked functionality. (The old site is found here: https://aaronw4.github.io/BOMG/staff.html)

I made the following updates:

* Updated the site to give it a new and cleaner design.
    * A proper home page
    * A new navigation menu
    * Larger fonts
    * Made useful links easier to find
* Made the site responsive
    * Creating navigation menu that appears while being viewed on cell phones
    * Images and margins were adjusted for tablet and mobile users
* Created scripts using JavaScript to add functionality.
    * Carousel
        * Allows the user to scroll through the different doctors
        * Business can add HTML for new doctors and the script will still work
    * Conditions
        * Uses *forEach* to loop through eye conditions and adds them to the web page
        * Business can add, edit, or remove conditions in the array to update their page
        * Added a button that allows user to show/hide text as they browse through the conditions
    * Menu
        * Gives the menu icon a toggle feature for showing/hiding the drop down nagition menu
        * The appearance of the menu icon is set in the CSS

Unfortunately, the business shut down recently. However the redesigned website can still be viewed here: https://aaronw4.github.io/BOMG-redesign/
